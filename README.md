# Election_Analysis
Purpose of analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to tally and track the votes of an county election. The information given to us to work with was Voter Registration, Voter County, and Candidate Choice. By taking down all of this information we are able to view possible demographics of counties by popularitity of candidates. Auditing the election gives a chance to vailidify the election with voter registration. Using python, we can easily count the votes with lines of code rather than tallying by hand.
